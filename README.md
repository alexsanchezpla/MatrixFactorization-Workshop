# Matrix Factorization Workshop

This repository contains the materials for a Workshop on Matrix Factorization and Multi Omics Data Integration that was first run in 2021 in the GRBio research group scientific retreat, and has, since then, been run several times.

Part of the workshop materials have been borrowed from the online version of the book [Computational Genomics with R](https://compgenomr.github.io/book/) which should be considered the main source for the materials.
